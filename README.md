# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This project is a part of the Foundations course where I will build a basic recipe website to practice HTML skills. The website will include a main index page with links to individual recipe pages. While the design will be simple, the focus is on developing a solid understanding of HTML structure and linking pages. Upon completion, I will have demonstrated the ability to create structured HTML documents, interlink web pages, and use Git for version control by setting up and maintaining a GitHub repository for the project.
